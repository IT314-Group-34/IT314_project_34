# About the project

The need for this project is simple: people need a better way to make informed decisions about where to live. 99acres provides valuable information on property valuations, but it falls short on providing a complete picture of a neighborhood - and let's be real, you want to know more than just how much your future home is worth. People need to know about school district quality, crime rates, local amenities, and more. Furthermore, relying solely on real estate listings doesn't give the whole story. That's where our project comes in - we're going to provide a one-stop-shop for all things "where to live" and let the people provide their two cents on the neighborhoods they know and love (or loathe).
