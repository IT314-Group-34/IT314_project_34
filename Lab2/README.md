# Introduction

The need for this project is simple: people need a better way to make informed decisions about where to live. 99acres provides valuable information on property valuations, but it falls short on providing a complete picture of a neighborhood - and let's be real, you want to know more than just how much your future home is worth. People need to know about school district quality, crime rates, local amenities, and more. Furthermore, relying solely on real estate listings doesn't give the whole story. That's where our project comes in - we're going to provide a one-stop-shop for all things "where to live" and let the people provide their two cents on the neighborhoods they know and love (or loathe). 

# **Needs for the project**

1. **Access to property information**
    - People who need to find a place to live or do business don't necessarily have to go there in person to receive the information.
    - On a single website, they may find all the information about neighbourhoods.
2. **Time saving**
    - It takes a lot of effort to gather information about numerous locations before selecting the best one.
    - This website gives users a location score based on their preferences, enabling them to choose more effectively and quickly.
3. **Budget friendly**
    - To receive the information you need and to find a place that fits your budget, you will need a broker. The cost is raised by this third party's involvement.
    - However, with the use of this website, a user can purchase a home without the assistance of a broker, making it more affordable.
4. **Security**
    - Due to the rising crime rate, it is difficult for users to verify all the property's paperwork and trust the owner.
    - This website will only include the verified locations, thus increasing the security of the user.
5. **Convenience**
    - This website will be accessible round-the-clock and from anywhere, making it easier for users to look for their dream home at any time or location.
6. **Lack of User Feedback**: 
    - Existing solutions do not provide the ability for users to share their experiences and provide feedback on different neighborhoods.
    - This makes it challenging for people to get a sense of the pros and cons of different areas and make informed decisions.

# **Features**

1. **User-account**
    - User accounts are commonly used in software development projects to facilitate collaboration between developers, project managers, and stakeholders.
    - Here in our project the user account will ask for various details like username, user-email, password to create an account on our project.
2. **Wishlist**
    - This list will contain all the neighbourhoods that one particular user has selected and kept aside before coming to final conclusion.
3. **Feedback and rating**
    - Users can rate neighbourhoods on various parameters such as the location, amenities, price, and quality of construction, among others.
    - The rating feature is an important tool that helps users make informed decisions by providing valuable insights and feedback from other users.
    - Users can provide feedback on various aspects of the service, such as the ease of use of the platform, the accuracy of property listings, etc.
4. **Comparison**
    - This is an efficient and easy to use feature for comparing and contrasting neighbourhoods. Allows users to compare two or more neighbourhoods based on specific criteria.
    - This feature is designed to help users make informed decisions or identify differences between options.
5.  **Filters**
    - Allows users to narrow down a large set of data to a more manageable subset based on specific criteria such as area, price range, square feet etc.
    - They can also help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the application by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and displayed.
    - The choice of implementation will depend on the specific requirements of the application and the preferences of the users.
6. **Recommendation**
    - Provides users with personalized suggestions or recommendations based on their preferences and previous search histories.
    - This feature can help to improve the overall user experience by reducing the time and effort required to find new and relevant content.
7. **Real Estate Integration**
    - An integration that allows users to connect with local real estate agents or real estate websites to purchase houses quickly and seamlessly. Additionally, users can access a range of resources and information to help them make an informed decision about their home purchase.

# Software Development Life Cycle Model

## Agile

Following are the reasons why Agile Model will be suitable for our project:  

1. Flexibility: Agile methodology is designed to be flexible and adaptable, which makes it ideal for student projects where changes in scope and requirements may be expected. This allows the team to respond to new information and changes quickly, without having to restart the entire project.
2. Incremental Delivery: Agile methodology encourages delivering small, incremental pieces of the project on a regular basis. This allows the team to get feedback and make adjustments quickly.
3. Team Collaboration: Agile methodology is centered around the idea of teamwork and collaboration, which is ideal for a group project where multiple team members will be working together. This will allow the team to communicate effectively and work together to overcome obstacles.
4. Prioritization: Agile methodology allows the team to prioritize tasks and make changes as necessary. This is particularly important in a student project where there may be limited time and resources, and the team needs to ensure that they are focusing on the most important tasks first.
5. Iterative Process: Agile methodology uses an iterative process, where the team can learn from each iteration and make improvements in subsequent cycles. This helps to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the user, and that the team is able to continuously improve their work over the course of the project.
